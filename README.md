# 4bit-comparator-verilog
This project implements a 4-bit comparator using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).
The comparator takes two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and outputs whether A is greater than, equal to, or less than B.

## Features
Compares two 4-bit binary numbers: A and B
output:
A_gt_B  (A > B) 
A_eq_B  (A == B)
A_lt_B  (A < B)
Includes testbench for simulation and waveform verification

## Tools Used
**Language**: Verilog HDL
**Simulation Tool**: Xilinx Vivado
**Waveform Viewer**: Vivado Simulation
